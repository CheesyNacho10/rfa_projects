Training, Optimization, and Evaluation of Linear Classifiers for Image Classification

Using at least two image sets from those described in the course introduction (MNIST, EMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), train, optimize, and evaluate at least two linear classifiers. The optimization and evaluation of the classifiers should explore the influence of the dimensionality reduction technique based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In particular, the experiment to be conducted will follow the following scheme:

1. Reading the image corpus.
2. Partitioning the data for training and testing.
3. Calculation of the SVD.
4. Adjusting and evaluating the classifier based on the number of dimensions.
